##CBSE Resultomator

A script to automate the process of generating data viz on basis of data from the CBSE results site.
Currently supports only 12th Grade results.

Based on the project https://github.com/anshuman73/2016-CBSE-Grade-12-Results , but faster, efficient, and more useful.
More than just a bet this time.
