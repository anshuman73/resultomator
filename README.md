## CBSE Resultomator

A script to automate the process of generating data viz on basis of data from the CBSE results site.
Currently supports only 12th Grade results.

Based on [this project](https://github.com/anshuman73/2016-CBSE-Grade-12-Results), but faster, efficient, and more useful.
More than just a bet this time.


**Incompatible with Python 2, Uses Python 3.**


## Speed Benchmarking -

**Tests were done on a regular home network (40-50 mbps) and generic config.**

*The script was run using Python 3 on Ubuntu 16.04*

Generated log at the end gave this (when using async data retrieval) -

```
Finished processing everything.
Took 13.299899101257324 seconds for execution
